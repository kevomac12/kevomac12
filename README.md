- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m kevomac12!
I am new to Python/PyCharm, about one full year of real use. Looking for help when necessary, writing funtional scripts!
My experiences are varied, from hardware to software. Starting with the Navy (Radars & Radio), to development of software applications (Mainframes to Windows/Linux/Mac)
in C, C++, DSP', FORTRAN, Java, VB. Failure analysis (TE) in H/W and S/W, with companies from IBM/HP/Hart Intercivic/STC/Miniscribe-Maxtor/Micron/Intel/SolidigmTechnology!
Just a working stiff, and thanks for asking...
