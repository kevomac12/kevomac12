- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @kevomac12
I am new to Python/PyCharm, about one full year of real use. Looking for help when necessary, in writing funtional scripts in Python!
My experiences are varied with regard to hardware and software. From the Navy (Radars & Radio), to development of software applications
in Java, C, C++. Failure analysis in H/W and S/W, with companies from IBM/HP/Hart Intercivic/STC/Miniscribe-Maxtor/Micron/Intel/SolidigmTechnology!
Just a working stiff.
